## Code Assumptions

1. The MRF energy has the following form  
   $$E(x) = \sum \theta_{i}(x_i) + \sum \theta_{ij} (x_i, x_j)\ ,$$  
   where $\theta_{ij} (x_i, x_j) = \gamma_{ij} \theta(|x_i - x_j|)$.
2. The code currently supports MRF with 4-connected grid structure only and nodes are labelled from 0 --> width * height - 1 in    raw major ordering.
